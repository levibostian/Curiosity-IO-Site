                | I started Curiosity IO to build the next great app with only the most passionate founders.

                | a user to uninstall your app. It wont be because of a bad user experience.

                            | mobile app, I get notified, fix the issue, and release a fix all without you

                            | is the best solution to solve your user's problem.
