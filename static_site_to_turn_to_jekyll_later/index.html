You will work with me every step of the way with your mobile app idea.</p><p class="measure center f4 tl">I started Curiosity IO to build the next great app with only the most passionate founders.
If you are ready to make your idea a reality, let's talk.</p><p class="measure center f4 tl">I have been building mobile apps for startups since 2013 and a freelancer long before that.
I mentor dozens of startups around the country helping them build the best
mobile apps. Expect me to treat you the same.</p><p class="measure center f4 tl">When you work with me, our top priority will be the end user of the mobile app. I practice
<a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design" target="_blank">User-Centered Design</a>
where decisions are made based on the user experience of the mobile app. It only takes 1 second for
a user to uninstall your app. It wont be because of a bad user experience.</p><div class="center"><a href="https://twitter.com/levibostian" target="_blank"><img class="mw2 pa1" src="img/twitter.svg"></a><a href="https://medium.com/@levibostian" target="_blank"><img class="mw2 pa1" src="img/medium.svg"></a><a href="mailto:levi@curiosityio.com"><img class="mw2 pa1" src="img/envelope.svg"></a></div><div class="w-100 bg-white content-center tc pt4" id="promises"><div class="bg-white w-80-m w-50-l center pa4 shadow-3 tl"><h2 class="f3 tc">This is what you can expect from me.</h2><hr class="mw6 bb bw1 b--black-10"><dl class="lh-title pa4-m pa4-l mt0 measure"><dt class="f3 b pt3">Intuitive design</dt><dd class="ml0">I take a lot of pride in my craft. Each project that I create is built from scratch.
I study the <a class="link" href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/" target="_blank">Apple</a> and
<a class="link" href="https://material.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>
design guidelines to assert that each mobile app looks and feels their very best.<br><br>I believe that if your mobile app requires a tutorial, you need to redesign it.
Your iPhone users will feel familiar with my iPhone apps and Android users will
feel familiar with my Android apps.</dd><dt class="f3 b pt3">Bug-free apps</dt><dd class="ml0">Your app will have issues. There is no such thing as completely bug-free software.
To get as close as we can, every time that one of your users has an issue with your
mobile app, I get notified, fix the issue, and release a fix all without you
realizing it.</dd><dt class="f3 b pt3">Build what provides the most value</dt><dd class="ml0">My apps are built from scratch for your end user. Your mobile app will look good, run
fast, and be fun to use.
I am a startup founder, like yourself, and I care most about providing value to the user.
In fact, the very first conversation we have together we will consider if a mobile app
is the best solution to solve your user's problem.</dd></dl></div></div></div></body></html>
