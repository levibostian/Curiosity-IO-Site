                | You may have arrived at this website to learn more about freelancing services to get your app idea built. It is true, Curiosity IO has been known for it's freelance Android and iOS app development services since 2015. #[b However, as of February 2021, Curiosity IO is no longer providing any services.]

                | I have enjoyed every single minute of freelancing the past 6 years. I have worked with over 100 different businesses and built over 25 mobile apps I am very proud of. I have grown more in love with building products and working with teams to get an idea to launch.

                | Curiosity IO was not originally created for freelancing. When I started it, I remember thinking to myself, #[i "I want a place where I can explore my curiosity with tech. Invent new ideas. Try out concepts never done before. I want a playground for myself to play."] For the past handful of years, Curiosity IO has been focused exclusively on providing freelance services and not so much being my playground. I am very excited to bring back Curiosity IO to it's original purpose. Believe me, my mind is exploding with ideas I want to try out!

                | I hope that you are able to find someone wonderful to build your next idea. Make sure you always have a playground to work on your ideas.
