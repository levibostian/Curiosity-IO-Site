You will work with me every step of the way with your mobile app idea.</p><p class="measure center f4 tl">I started Curiosity IO to build the next great app with only the most passionate founders.
If you are ready to make your idea a reality, let's talk.</p><p class="measure center f4 tl">I have been building mobile apps for startups since 2013 and a freelancer long before that.
I mentor dozens of startups around the country helping them build the best
mobile apps. Expect me to treat you the same.</p><p class="measure center f4 tl">When you work with me, our top priority will be the end user of the mobile app. I practice
<a class="link light-silver pointer link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design" target="_blank">User-Centered Design</a>
where decisions are made based on the user experience of the mobile app. It only takes 1 second for
a user to uninstall your app. It wont be because of a bad user experience.</p><div class="center"><a href="https://twitter.com/levibostian" target="_blank"><img class="mw2 pa1" src="img/twitter.svg"></a><a href="https://medium.com/@levibostian" target="_blank"><img class="mw2 pa1" src="img/medium.svg"></a><a href="mailto:levi@curiosityio.com"><img class="mw2 pa1" src="img/envelope.svg"></a></div><div class="w-100 bg-white content-center tc pt4" id="promises"><div class="bg-white w-80-m w-50-l center pa4 shadow-3 tl"><h2 class="f3 tc">This is what you can expect from me.</h2><hr class="mw6 bb bw1 b--black-10"><dl class="lh-title pa4-m pa4-l mt0 measure"><dt class="f3 b pt3">Intuitive design</dt><dd class="ml0">I take a lot of pride in my craft. Each project that I create is built from scratch.
I study the <a class="link light-silver pointer link" href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/" target="_blank">Apple</a> and
<a class="link light-silver pointer" href="https://material.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>
design guidelines to assert that each mobile app looks and feels their very best.<br><br>I believe that if your mobile app requires a tutorial, you need to redesign it.
Your iPhone users will feel familiar with my iPhone apps and Android users will
feel familiar with my Android apps.</dd><dt class="f3 b pt3">Bug-free apps</dt><dd class="ml0">Your app will have issues. There is no such thing as completely bug-free software.
To get as close as we can, every time that one of your users has an issue with your
mobile app, I get notified, fix the issue, and release a fix all without you
realizing it.</dd><dt class="f3 b pt3">Build what provides the most value</dt><dd class="ml0">My apps are built from scratch for your end user. Your mobile app will look good, run
fast, and be fun to use.
I am a startup founder, like yourself, and I care most about providing value to the user.
In fact, the very first conversation we have together we will consider if a mobile app
is the best solution to solve your user's problem.</dd></dl></div></div></div><div class="w-100 bg-white tc" id="process"><div class="bg-near-black"><h1 class="f1 white pa4 f-subheadline-m f-headline-l">Process</h1></div><h1 class="f3 f2-ns mw5 mw6-ns center">Here is my process we will go through together.</h1><dl class="lh-title pa2 mt0 measure tl w-80-m w-50-l center"><dt class="f3 b pt3">Consulting</dt><dd class="ml0">One reason why I love my job so much is I get to meet founders who want to make the world
a better place. The first step to working together is for me to understand two questions really well:
<i>"What is the problem you are working to solve?"</i> and <i>"Who is your customer?"</i>. From there we can
start to rock and roll.<br><br>The consulting phase consists of one or two phone calls and emails.
It's never too early to contact me about your idea (in fact, it's better to be early then late).
Don't attempt to create a 30 page document explaining your idea. It's simply not needed. Contact me and I will help you to collect the
information that I need for us to move forward.<br><br>Please, I would be delighted if you <a class="link light-silver pointer" href="mailto:levi@curiosityio.com">email me hello</a> and tell
me about yourself and your project.</dd><dt class="f3 b pt3">Design</dt><dd class="ml0">After I have collected the information I need, it's time to start building this app. I work with
talented professional designers who are experts at telling stories. We can create a brand for you
or build an app formed around your existing brand.<br><br>To start the design phase, I create a paper and pencil mockup of your mobile app. Paper and pencil
seems low-tech but it allows us to find the best design quickly. After my designers and I are happy
with our paper and pencil mockups, we put them to the test. We test the mockups with real people who
have never heard of your product before to see if they find the app easy to use.<br><br>After testing is performed, we make changes to our designs and finalize it. We create a digital version
of the paper and pencil mockups to closely resemble the final product. This is the first time that
you get to really <i>feel</i> your idea in your hand on your phone.</dd><dt class="f3 b pt3">Development</dt><dd class="ml0">After you have checked off design, it is time to make your idea real.
I develop your mobile app in 1 week sprints. What this means is this: Once a week you will receive
a YouTube video from me with a demo of the progress from the past week. Also, I create a build of
your mobile app that you actually install on your devices to start using.<br><br>Have a list of email addresses of users ready to beta test your mobile app? Awesome. We can add
all of your beta customers at any time from day 1 of development. The more the merrier.<br><br>I have been writing code for half of my young life. I am a geek at heart and proud of it. I develop clean code
that you can feel confident handing to your future development team after I am complete. I offer my contact
information to you and your future developers if they have questions. I am proud to say I receive
nothing but compliments back from the developers!</dd></dl></div><div class="w-100 bg-white tc" id="faq"><div class="bg-near-black"><h1 class="f1 white pa4 f-subheadline-m f-headline-l">FAQ</h1></div><dl class="lh-title pa2 mt0 measure tl w-80-m w-50-l center"><dt class="f3 b pt3">Q: What if there is a new feature that I want to add in 2 months after we launch?</dt><dd class="ml0">A: We go through the cycle again for this new feature.

you pay the invoice in full, then we perform the full design phase and deliver the result to you.</li><li><strong>Development</strong>: Project based pricing. After the design phase is complete, I create an invoice for the cost of the entire development
